## COTAN 2.0.1

Updated `README.md` and `NEWS.md`

Renamed methods dealing with housekeeping genes and fully-expressed cells to use
the more proper names fully-expressed genes and fully-expressing cells

## COTAN 2.0.0

Final release in Bioconductor 3.17

## COTAN 1.99.4

Solved remaining documentation warnings

## COTAN 1.99.3

## COTAN 1.99.1

Minor bug fixes and new function clustersMarkersHeatmapPlot()

## COTAN 1.99.0

Included new functionalities for Bioc 2.17 release:

* created a new `COTAN` class to replace the old `scCOTAN`: this class provides
  internal invariants along a wide host of accessors that allows users to avoid
  peeking inside the class
  
* made a new multi-core implementation of the model parameters estimations and
  `COEX` calculations that achieves much higher speeds.
  
* added new functionality about **gene clusters** starting from given markers
  lists

* added new functionality about **uniform cell clustering** based on the maximum
  *GDI* level in the *cluster*
  
* added function to get a *differential expression* estimation for each cluster
  against background
  
* added function to get an *enrichment score* for each cluster given a list of
  markers specific for the cells' population
  
* added plots to asses data-set information at cleaning stage

## COTAN 0.99.13

After official release. PCA function changed to avoid basilisk and Python.
 
## COTAN 0.99.12

Release before the official release of Bioc 3.15. Main changes:
 - The way in which the COEX matrix is estimated and stored is changed to occupy
   less space and run faster.
 
## COTAN 0.99.10

Initial Bioconductor release
