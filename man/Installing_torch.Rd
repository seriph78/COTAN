\title{Installing torch R library (on Linux)}
\description{
A brief explanation of how to install the torch package on WLS2
Linux. Naturally it makes a difference whether one wants to install support
only for the \code{CPU} or also have the eventual system \code{GPU} at the ready!

The main resources to install \code{torch} is
\url{https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation.html} or
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/torch/vignettes/installation.html}
}
\details{
For the \code{CPU}-only support one need to ensure that also numeric
libraries are installed, like BLAS and LAPACK and/or MKL if your \code{CPU} is
from Intel. Otherwise torch will be stuck at using a single core for all
computations.

For the \code{GPU}, currently only \code{cuda} devices are supported. Moreover
only some specific versions of \code{cuda} (and corresponding \code{cudnn}) are
effectively usable, so one needs to install them to actually use the \code{GPU}.

Currently only \code{cuda} 11.7 and 11.8 are supported, but check the \code{torch}
documentation for more up-to-date information. Before downgrading your
\code{cuda} version, please be aware that it is possible to maintain separate
main versions of \code{cuda} contemporaneously on the system: that is one can
have installed 11.8 and a 12.4 \code{cuda} versions at the same time.

Below a link to install \code{cuda} 11.8 for \code{WSL2} Linux Windows sub-system is
given: use a local installer to be sure the wanted \code{cuda} version is being
installed, and not the latest one: \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local}{cuda 11.8 for WSL2}
}
