\title{Installing torch R library (on Linux)}
\description{
A brief explanation of how to install the torch package on
\code{WSL2} (Windows Subsystem for Linux), but it might work the same for other
\code{Linux} systems. Naturally it makes a difference whether one wants to
install support only for the \code{CPU} or also have the system \code{GPU} at the
ready!

The main resources to install \code{torch} is
\url{https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation.html} or
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/torch/vignettes/installation.html}
}
\details{
For the \code{CPU}-only support one need to ensure that also numeric
libraries are installed, like \code{BLAS} and \code{LAPACK} and/or \code{MKL} if your
\code{CPU} is from \emph{Intel}. Otherwise \code{torch} will be stuck at using a single
core for all computations.

For the \code{GPU}, currently only \code{cuda} devices are supported. Moreover
only some specific versions of \code{cuda} (and corresponding \code{cudnn}) are
effectively usable, so one needs to install them to actually use the \code{GPU}.

As of today only \code{cuda} 12.4 is supported, but check the \code{torch}
documentation for more up-to-date information. Before downgrading your
\code{cuda} version, please be aware that it is possible to maintain separate
main versions of \code{cuda} at the same time on the system: that is one can
have installed both 11.8 and a 12.4 \code{cuda} versions on the same system.

Below a link to install \code{cuda} 11.8 for \code{WSL2} given: use a local installer
to be sure the wanted \code{cuda} version is being installed, and not the latest
one: \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local}{\code{cuda} 12.4 for \code{WSL2}}
