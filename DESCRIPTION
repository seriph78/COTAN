Description: Statistical and computational method to analyze the co-expression of 
    gene pairs at single cell level. It provides the foundation for single-cell gene 
    interactome analysis. The basic idea is studying the zero UMI counts’ distribution 
    instead of focusing on positive counts; this is done with a generalized contingency 
    tables framework. COTAN can effectively assess the correlated or anti-correlated 
    expression of gene pairs. It provides a numerical index related to the correlation and an 
    approximate p-value for the associated independence test. COTAN can also evaluate whether 
    single genes are differentially expressed, scoring them with a newly defined global 
    differentiation index. Moreover, this approach provides ways to plot and cluster genes
    according to their co-expression pattern with other genes, effectively helping the study 
    of gene interactions and becoming a new tool to identify cell-identity marker genes.
